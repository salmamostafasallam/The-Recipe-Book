              <h2>Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
              <img class="roundimg" src="img/chewy cookie.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">
              <p>Ingredients:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, melted & cooled 5 minutes</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Instructions:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.</li>
                <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. </li>
                <li>Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

                      <img class="roundimg" src="img/crispy cookies.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">
                      <p>Ingredients:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (188g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>10 Tablespoons (142g) unsalted butter, melted + slightly cooled</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                        <li>2 Tablespoons (43g) honey or light corn syrup</li>
                        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                        <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) milk</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

                      </ul>
                      <p>Instructions:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Whisk the melted butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, honey, egg yolk, milk, and vanilla extract together until combined.</li>
                        <li>Pour into dry ingredients and mix everything together until completely combined. Fold in the chocolate chips. (You can use a mixer for this step if needed.)</li>
                        <li>For thin and crisp cookies, do not chill the cookie dough and proceed with step 5. For slightly thicker and crisp cookies, cover and chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour then preheat the oven.</li>
                        <li>For slightly thicker cookies with soft centers and crisp edges, cover and chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for 2 hours then preheat the oven.</li>
                        <li>Roll cookie dough into balls, 1 scant Tablespoon of dough per cookie, and arrange 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 10-11 minutes or until browned on top and around the sides.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies crisp up as they cool.</li>

                      <h2>Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
                      <img class="roundimg" src="img/red velvet cookies.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">
                      <p>Ingredients:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1 and 2/3 cups (210g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup (21g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
                        <li>1 Tablespoon milk (I recommend buttermilk)</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>3/4 teaspoon gel red food coloring (or alternative)</li>
                        <li>1 cup (180g) white or semi-sweet chocolate chips (plus a few extra for tops)</li>

                      </ul>
                      <p>Instructions:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix on high until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.</li>
                        <li>Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, add the milk and food coloring, and then mix on low speed until everything is combined. The dough will be sticky. If you want a more vibrant hue, beat in more food coloring a little at a time. Add the chocolate chips and beat on low speed until just combined.</li>
                        <li>Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (and up to 3 days). I recommend just 1 to 2 hours, otherwise the cookies won’t spread much. If chilling for longer than 2 hours, allow dough to sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Scoop and roll cookie dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons (30–35g) of dough each. (A medium cookie scoop is helpful here.) Arrange on the baking sheet about 3 inches apart. Bake for 11–13 minutes or until the edges appear set. Centers will look very soft. If the cookies didn’t spread, simply press down on the warm cookies with the back of a spoon to slightly flatten. </li>
                        <li>If desired, lightly press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies.</li>
