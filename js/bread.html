            <h2>Sandwich Bread</h2>
            <img class="roundimg" src="../img/sandwich bread.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>⅔ cup warm milk</li>
                <li>½ cup warm water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>3 cups unbleached all purpose flour, plus more if needed</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, water, sugar, and yeast. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter and salt. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes until the butter melts and the salt dissolves.</li>
        <li>Add the flour to the milk mixture in small amounts, whisking until a smooth batter forms. Continue adding flour until you have a soft, slightly sticky dough. If the dough is too thick, add a little more milk or water. If it's too thin, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Once the dough is smooth and elastic, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>After the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and a pinch of salt. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes until the egg becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Divide the risen dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope, then braid the ropes together. Tie the braid in a knot at one end to prevent unraveling.</li>
        <li>Place the braided loaves on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the top of each loaf with the beaten egg mixture. Let the loaves rise for another 30 minutes or until they have doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Allow the loaves to cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>

            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>2 to 3 medium, peeled bananas(about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
              <li>1/3 cup butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
              <li>1 pinch salt</li>
              <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
              <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
              <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas, melted butter, baking soda, salt, sugar, and beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft, smooth batter forms. If the batter is too thick, add a little more milk or water. If it's too thin, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan or a bundt pan. Bake in a preheated 350°F (175°C) oven for 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the loaf to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <h2>Soft Dinner Rolls</h2>
    <img class="roundimg" src="../img/dinner rolls.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 -5 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rapid rise, instant yeast</li>
      <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1½ cups warm milk</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 egg , room temperature</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine 3 cups of flour, yeast, sugar, salt, warm milk, butter, and egg in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
<li>Attach the dough hook and turn the mixer on to the lowest speed and mix until flour is incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.</li>
<li>Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add 1/2 cup flour and blend with the dough hook until incorporated. And another 1/2 cup flour and repeat, mixing at medium speed for another 2 minutes until a ball of dough is formed.</li>
<li>Add additional flour as necessary. The dough should be slightly sticky and soft and pulling away from the edge of the bowl.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Let rise for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
<li>Remove the towel or plastic wrap and deflate the dough by punching down lightly.</li>
<li>Pinch off pieces of the dough and form 24 rolls. You can weigh them to keep the rolls close to the same size. Mine were about 2 ounces each but this will vary depending on how much flour you added.</li>
<li>Transfer the rolls to a lightly greased quarter baking sheet or 9 x 13 baking dish. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake the rolls for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. If the rolls are getting too brown, just tent the rolls with foil.</li>
<li>Remove rolls and brush hot rolls with the melted butter. Serve immediately or store cooled rolls in a plastic bag for up to 3 days.</li>
